# SFDX Simple App

[![Deploy](https://deploy-to-sfdx.com/dist/assets/images/DeployToSFDX.svg)](https://deploy-to-sfdx.com/)

> **Important:** Salesforce DX is available as a Beta. Salesforce DX isn’t generally available unless or until Salesforce announces its general availability in documentation or in press releases or public statements. All commands, parameters, and other features are subject to change or deprecation at any time, with or without notice. Don't implement functionality developed with these commands or tools.

The Salesforce Developer Experience (SFDX) starts with source code living in your version control system.

## Set Up the Salesforce DX Project

Our first goal is to set up a developer project which we'll use to modify our application. It starts by cloning the repository. Use the command ...

    git clone https://github.com/forcedotcom/sfdx-simple.git

… or ...

    git clone git@github.com:forcedotcom/sfdx-simple.git

… to clone the repository. Then, open the directory.

    cd sfdx-simple
    
## Steps

Authorize to your Developer Hub (Dev Hub) org.

    sfdx force:auth:web:login -d -a "Hub Org"

If you already have an authorized Dev Hub, set it as the default:

    sfdx force:config:set defaultdevhubusername=<username|alias>

Create a scratch org.

    sfdx force:org:create -s -f config/project-scratch-def.json

If you want to use an existing scratch org, set it as the default:

    sfdx force:config:set defaultausername=<username|alias>

Push your source.

    sfdx force:source:push

Run your tests.

    sfdx force:apex:test:run
    sfdx force:apex:test:report -i <id>

Open the scratch org.

    sfdx force:org:open --path one/one.app
